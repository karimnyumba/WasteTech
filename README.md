## Introduction
WasteTech is a comprehensive waste management solution aimed at addressing the global waste management challenge and promoting sustainable practices in cities and communities. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, along with creation of utility recyclables, WasteTech offers an innovative approach to waste management.

This project was developed as part of the Power Hacks Hackathon, with the aim of creating a sustainable solution aligned with SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.

## Features
- **AI and IoT Integration:** WasteTech utilizes AI and IoT technologies to optimize waste collection, sorting, and recycling processes. This enables efficient waste management and reduces the burden on manual sorting.
- **Blockchain Technology:** By leveraging blockchain, WasteTech ensures transparent and traceable waste tracking and management. This enhances accountability and promotes a circular economy.
- **Creation of Utility Recyclables:** WasteTech focuses on creating utility recyclables from waste materials, transforming them into valuable resources. This promotes a circular economy and minimizes waste generation.
- **Gamification of Plastic Waste:** WasteTech incorporates a gamification element to encourage active citizen participation. Users can track their waste disposal habits, earn points, and compete with friends. Educational challenges and rewards motivate individuals to reduce, recycle, and properly dispose of plastic waste, fostering community engagement.
